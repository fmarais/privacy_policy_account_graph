The following permission is required by the application, android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE. This is required in order to read the phone text messages to read the required information to build up the graph.

We do not collect or send any personal information about the user. All the data application reads and creates for the graph stays on your device and will not be sent to any server.

We do however do send anonymous debug data if an error or crash occurs on the application to help us debug the error using the standard android error reporting tool Crashlytics.
